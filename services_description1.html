                    Handloom weaving is an ancient and revered craft that has significantly shaped the cultural,
                    economic, and social fabric of numerous societies throughout history. The art of traditional
                    handloom weaving involves the meticulous creation of textiles by interlacing threads on a loom
                    operated manually. This intricate and time-honored technique has been practiced for thousands of
                    years, resulting in beautiful textiles celebrated for their craftsmanship, durability, and unique
                    cultural expressions.

                    Handloom fabrics are meticulously crafted by skilled artisans who carefully select yarns, set up the
                    loom, and weave intricate patterns. Each handwoven piece tells a story—of tradition, heritage, and
                    the hands that worked tirelessly to create it. From vibrant sarees to elegant shawls, handloom
                    textiles showcase the rich diversity of India’s weaving traditions.

                    Fabric printing is the process of transferring designs onto textiles, widely used in fashion, home décor, and artwork. Key methods include:
                    <br>Screen Printing: 
                    This uses stencils and ink layers, ideal for bold, durable designs in bulk but less suited for intricate details.
                    <br>Digital Printing:
                     Similar to inkjet printing, it provides vibrant colors and detailed designs directly on fabric, suitable for small or custom orders but can be costly.
                    <br>Heat Transfer: 
                    Involves applying a printed design from paper onto fabric with heat; it’s versatile but may wear over time.
                    <br>Sublimation:
                    Uses heat to transfer dye into polyester, resulting in long-lasting colors but limited to specific materials
                    <br>Block Printing: 
                    A traditional, manual technique using carved blocks to press patterns, valued for its artisanal look.
                    <br>Wear a Piece of History:
