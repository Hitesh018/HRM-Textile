                    Handloom weaving is an ancient and revered craft that has significantly shaped the cultural,
                    economic, and social fabric of numerous societies throughout history. The art of traditional
                    handloom weaving involves the meticulous creation of textiles by interlacing threads on a loom
                    operated manually. This intricate and time-honored technique has been practiced for thousands of
                    years, resulting in beautiful textiles celebrated for their craftsmanship, durability, and unique
                    cultural expressions.

                    Handloom fabrics are meticulously crafted by skilled artisans who carefully select yarns, set up the
                    loom, and weave intricate patterns. Each handwoven piece tells a story—of tradition, heritage, and
                    the hands that worked tirelessly to create it. From vibrant sarees to elegant shawls, handloom
                    textiles showcase the rich diversity of India’s weaving traditions.

                    Fabric bleaching is a chemical process used to whiten textiles, remove natural color, and prepare fabrics for dyeing or printing. It’s a key step in textile finishing, as it enhances fabric appearance, softness, and absorbency.
                    <br>Types of Bleaching:
                    <br>Oxidative Bleaching: Commonly uses hydrogen peroxide, which is effective for natural fibers like cotton and linen. It produces minimal fabric damage, is eco-friendly, and suitable for both continuous and batch processing.
                    <br>Reductive Bleaching: Often uses sodium hydrosulfite, effective for synthetic fibers like polyester. It’s faster than oxidative methods but may produce more toxic residues and is less eco-friendly.
                    <br>Process Overview:
                    The fabric is cleaned to remove impurities, soaked in a bleaching agent, and then thoroughly rinsed to remove any chemicals.
                    Temperature, pH, and concentration of chemicals are carefully controlled to prevent fabric damage and achieve uniform whiteness.
                    <br>Considerations:
                    Environmental Impact: Bleaching requires water and can produce harmful by-products, making eco-friendly methods and chemical recycling important.
                    Fabric Sensitivity: Different fibers respond uniquely to bleaching, so careful handling is essential to avoid weakening or discoloring fabrics.
