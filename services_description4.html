                    Handloom weaving is an ancient and revered craft that has significantly shaped the cultural,
                    economic, and social fabric of numerous societies throughout history. The art of traditional
                    handloom weaving involves the meticulous creation of textiles by interlacing threads on a loom
                    operated manually. This intricate and time-honored technique has been practiced for thousands of
                    years, resulting in beautiful textiles celebrated for their craftsmanship, durability, and unique
                    cultural expressions.

                    Handloom fabrics are meticulously crafted by skilled artisans who carefully select yarns, set up the
                    loom, and weave intricate patterns. Each handwoven piece tells a story—of tradition, heritage, and
                    the hands that worked tirelessly to create it. From vibrant sarees to elegant shawls, handloom
                    textiles showcase the rich diversity of India’s weaving traditions.

                    Centering of fabrics is a preparation process used in textile manufacturing to ensure that fabrics are properly aligned, particularly before cutting, printing, or sewing. This process is critical for creating symmetrical designs, avoiding distortions, and ensuring that patterns or prints appear consistent across the final product.
                    <br>Why Centering is Important:
                    <br>Pattern Consistency: For patterned or printed fabrics, centering ensures that the design aligns symmetrically and flows naturally across seams.
                    <br>Quality Control: Proper alignment avoids skewing or distortion, improving the aesthetic appeal and quality of the final product.
                    <br>Efficient Cutting: Centered fabric allows for accurate cuts, reducing material waste and ensuring that all pieces fit well during assembly.
                    <br>Techniques:
                    Manual Centering: Involves manually aligning the fabric edges and securing it before processing. This is common in small-scale or artisanal production.
                    Machine Centering: Automated machines use sensors to detect fabric edges and adjust alignment, commonly used in large-scale production.
                    Centering is essential for achieving high-quality, professional-looking textile products
